      <h2>About Us:</h2>
      <p>3DXcel is a non-profit organization dedicated to making 3D printing and learning CAD  accessible to all individuals, regardless of their background or financial means. We firmly believe that every person should have the opportunity to explore and harness the potential of 3D printing technology. Through our innovative programs and community initiatives, we aim to empower individuals, foster creativity, and drive positive change.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="about-section">
      <h2>Our Story:</h2>
      <p>3DXcel came from a shared passion for 3D printing and a desire to bridge the gap between technology and education. A group of like-minded individuals, including engineers, designers, and educators, recognized the transformative power of 3D printing but also understood the barriers preventing many people from accessing it. With this realization, our organization was born. We started with a humble 3D printer in a small workshop and began offering free classes to teach the fundamentals of 3D printing and CAD software. As word spread and interest grew, so did our resources and impact. Through the dedication and support of our volunteers, donors, and partners, we expanded our reach and built a strong foundation for our mission.</p>
